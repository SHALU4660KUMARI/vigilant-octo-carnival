Galaxy is unique Subway of planets and stars and moon's.
The milkiway galaxy is the second last subway galaxy before which is vast Emeralds galaxy which have huge Sun as a star which is not the brightest among other stars, in comparison.

Solar rays are hereby very much delicate for the aforementioned galaxy Emeralds and it have 56 planets having no life or maybe it can have somewhat of it but no one know on which planet.

No one knows what kind of creatures they are or what kind of aliens they are, maybe like us or more poor in brain segmentation.

After planet Earth Endwar, the eclipse will turn red and the third last planet will grow life on every 56th planet through energies that we grow on earth.

Positive energy will reach quickly and negative will reach later like dimensions of monarchy innocense and unlike 21st century unholy democracy.
